Music, graphic and concept:
fenicenera

It was my first attempt to make a game during a jam, 
and also my first attempt to make and publish a game ever.
Even though it is not completed due to university and several commitments,
I am proud of what I have achieved in almost 4 days and I will keep on updating this
little project with all my effort and motivation over the jam.

Thank you for playing.[/center]
